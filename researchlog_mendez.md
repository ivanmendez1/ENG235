Introduction |
My name is Ivan Mendez and I am taking this course to because it is required to graduate. I am a student here at Pierce and at UWT.
I have been admitted to the Computer Science and Systems major and I'm here at Pierce to finish up some classes that are required for the degree. [Search] (google.com)

Initial underst. |
I did not know what technical writing was until I started this class. At first I thought it explored the structure and layout of writing, but 
now I understand it to be a translation from you're work into something that others can read and follow just as you have done. It is like writing an
instruction book or a textbook.

Set up |
Creating a repository was pretty straightforward as I have created repositories in the past following a set of instructions which in of itself has 
taught me a little more about technical writing. I didn't face any difficulties because I followed the instructions to the letter and I had it done quickly.

Purpose, audience, delivery |
The purpose of PierceHacker and Programming Historian is to put out instructions of a certain topic so that you can do it yourself.  The audience is anybody who is interested in learning how to do those things. For example this is the description on the PierceHacker site "PierceHacker provides tutorials and other resources in order to help the Pierce College community develop new technical skills and better understand the ways in which technology shapes the work we do both in and out of the classroom." In this case the main audience would be the students at Pierce College, but it is open to anyone. This comes down to the medium of delivery. The PierceHacker tutorials are there for students to access and most likely only students would know about this site. Here you can also contribute a tutorial so other fellow students can access as well. 

The Programming Historian works exactly the same way except is caters to a much, much bigger audience. Generally this audience is the internet, which is everybody who has access to the internet. But unlike PierceHacker which has tutorials from things like podcasts to e-portfolios, the categories at the Historian have more varierty that deals in things like data management to network analysis sections which have lessons or tutorials based on those categories.

End of Week 1|
I learned a great deal at then end of the first week of class. I came into this class not knowing what it was, only that I needed it. Technical writing was not at all what I thought and now I know that its the writing that others see to help them understand what they're working on. For example, a manual for a car. I practiced a little on how to make instructions using legos, I created a Github account using instructions, I learned what The Programming Historian and PierceHacker were and how to create research logs. Although this was a rought log, I will begin to write  more detailed and involved log for the upcoming weeks.
