Introduction |
My name is Ivan Mendez and I am taking this course to because it is required to graduate. I am a student here at Pierce and at UWT.
I have been admitted to the Computer Science and Systems major and I'm here at Pierce to finish up some classes that are required for the degree.

Initial underst. |
I did not know what technical writing was until I started this class. At first I thought it explored the structure and layout of writing, but 
now I understand it to be a translation from you're work into something that others can read and follow just as you have done. It is like writing an
instruction book or a textbook.

Set up |
Creating a repository was pretty straightforward as I have created repositories in the past following a set of instructions which in of itself has 
taught me a little more about technical writing. I didn't face any difficulties because I followed the instructions to the letter and I had it done quickly.
