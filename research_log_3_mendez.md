**Challenge** | One of the biggest challenges in composing a survey is asking the right questions to find the answers that will get you
the best results. Since I had never written a survey, it was hard to try to create the right question, but then I thought of the times
I had taken a survey and tried to ask questions that got directly to the point without having the reader think about it. Since some surveys
can be quite long, the questions have to be answered effortlessly. Collaborating was another challenging part because any one of us probably
had never written survey we did not know how to approach the problem. For us, it seemed too vague of  question and we had to be direct
when we ask others. I knew we were making tutorials, I knew it had to be about accessing homework assignments through a cloud service, but what
was it that I needed to ask? _Are we creating  a question about how to use Google Drive? Are we asking if they have used anything like that or 
whether they would use it at all?_ In the end, we knew we had to see if people were interested in learning how to submit and access their files 
online, rather than just doing it on their personal computer. That was the mindset we had as we created these questions.
